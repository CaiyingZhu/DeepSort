### Reference-free Cell-type Annotation for Single-cell Transcriptomics using Deep Learning with a Weighted Graph Neural Network

Recent advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled large-scale transcriptional characterization of thousands of cells in multiple complex tissues, in which accurate cell type identification becomes the prerequisite and vital step for scRNA-seq studies. Here, we introduce DeepSort, a reference-free cell-type annotation tool for single-cell transcriptomics that uses a deep learning model with a weighted graph neural network.
